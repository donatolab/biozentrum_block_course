## Working with suite2p

1. We begin by loading the anaconda envrioment. 
We will work from the command prompt for now. 
So, in windows start the command terminal for anaconda by typing 
in "anaconda" in the windows task bar and clicking on "command prompt".


2. Next, we need to activate our anaconda environment that we want to work in.  
So we type in the command line:

`conda activate suite2p`


3. We should now be ready to load suite2p:

`suite2p`


4. If all goes well you will get the suite2p GUI!
... but we don't have our datasets yet.  To download them, follow this link:
